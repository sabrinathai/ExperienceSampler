        Customize this policy to fit your own app's needs. For more guidance, see:

        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
        -->
        <!-- You will need to change the url that follows connect-src-->
        <!-- If you are using a google database, you will need two urls, the url for your actual data collector, and https://script.googleusercontent.com/macros/echo
